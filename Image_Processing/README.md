In this project a Pre-trained Image Classifier to identify dog breeds.

The Image Classifier is an application using a deep learning model called a convolutional neural network (often abbreviated as CNN). CNNs work particularly well for detecting features in images like colors, textures, and edges; then using these features to identify objects in the images.

Inorder to use this package
1. create a folder in this repo and name it "uploaded_images" 
2. Add file images of what you want to classify
3. Ensure the file images are named after the image e.g if you are uploading the image of German Shepherd  dog the filename should look like this German_Shepherd.png or GermanShepherd.jpg, or German-Shepherd.png
4. Then, open your terminal and run this code, without the " "----> "sh run_models_batch_uploaded.sh"
